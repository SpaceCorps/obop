//! The scan that keeps the instance brand to one reader (docs/spec/branding.md, sections 4 and 13:
//! "no code outside the module `obop_commands::brand` reads the model `instance_brand`"). The
//! record is public by design and every surface that shows a name reads it through the one
//! reader, `Dispatcher::brand()`, with its cache, its last good value and its fail-closed
//! `strict()`. A second reader (a page, a handler or the shop that asks the store for the row
//! itself) would show a value the reader would have refused, and none of the pins of an instance
//! with no brand row would notice, because they render without a row.
//!
//! **What it catches.** In the non-test Rust code of every crate under `crates/` (walked
//! recursively; test code, the files of test-only modules and `tests/` and `benches/` directories
//! are left out, comments are blanked; see `src_scan.rs`), outside the files named in [`ALLOWED`]:
//! - the model name `instance_brand`, in code (it is part of `instance_brand_model`) or in a
//!   string literal;
//! - a path that starts at the module `brand` (`brand::strict`, `crate::brand::Reader`,
//!   `obop_commands::brand::apply`; not `obop_brand::`, the leaf crate of the rules, which has no
//!   store);
//! - a call `.brand()` or `::brand(` (the reader of the dispatcher) and the identifier
//!   `install_brand` (what creates it).
//!
//! **A row of [`ALLOWED`] is the decision that a file may read or write the brand.** It names the
//! file and the reason, and it must match something: a row that no longer matches is a failure, so
//! the list cannot go stale. The slice that makes a surface show the brand adds the file of that
//! surface here, with its reason, in the commit that wires it.
//!
//! **What it does not see.** It is a textual scan, not a parser. Text built at run time
//! (`format!("{}_brand", "instance")`), the model reached through a constant of another crate that
//! is not spelled in the file, a reader passed in as a trait object by a file that is on the list,
//! and Rust outside `crates/` are not seen. It makes a second reader visible; it does not stop one
//! who works around it. The behaviour is held by `crates/obop/src/brand_row_tests.rs`: with a
//! row, every output that is pinned is what it was without one.
